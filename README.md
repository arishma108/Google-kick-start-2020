# Quick Intro: 

Kick Start is a global online coding competition, consisting of three-hour rounds of a variety of algorithmic challenges designed by Google engineers. Participants can compete in one or all online rounds held throughout the year, and will have the opportunity to develop and grow their programming abilities while getting a glimpse into the technical skills needed for a career at Google (top participants may be invited to interview at Google).

# What is Kick Start?
Kick Start offers coders around the world the chance to develop and hone their programming skills through online-hosted competition rounds. The three-hour rounds feature a variety of algorithmic challenges, all developed by Google engineers so that programmers get a taste of the technical skills needed for a career at Google (the top competitors from the Kick Start rounds may be invited to interview at Google!). The rounds are held regularly throughout the year at different times so they are easily accessible to coders everywhere. Each Kick Start Round is open to all participants, no pre-qualification needed, so you can try your hand at one or give them all a shot.

# How it works
Register for Kick Start to compete in any round you’d like! When each round is open, the three hour countdown begins and you’ll compete on the google website solving algorithmic and mathematical problems.
